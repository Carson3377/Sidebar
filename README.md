JavaScript Project --

# Sidebar
 
In this JavaScript project, we're going to create a sidebar this time with animation effects along with a toggle.At first, you will only see a visible toggle performing a bouncing effect on the blank page. Once your javascript functionality is worked, you'll be able to see a visible and moveable sidebar when the toggle is clicked. [Sidebar](https://carson3377.github.io/Sidebar/sidebar.html)

The JavaScript key methods may be applied:

- document.querySelector()
--> Select CSS selectors '.sidebar-toggle', '.sidebar', and '.close-btn' link to the buttons.


- addEventListener()
--> Include an event listener to listen event 'click' for the toggle and close buttons.


- classList.toggle()
--> Return CSS classname 'show-sidebar' of the toggle method.


- classList.remove()
--> Return and bind with remove method to remove the CSS classname 'show-sidebar'.


- If Else Statement
--> Decide the toggle button to open or close the content.


- Contains()
--> Returns true if a node is a descendant of a node, else false.



That's a Wrap!
